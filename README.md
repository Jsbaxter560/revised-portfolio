# revised-portfolio

This project felt like a bit of a breath of fresh air compared to what has been going on in recent weeks, but no rest for the wicked... If I survive this week I'll be able to deal with essentially anything.

## getting started

fortunately, this is something I've done before, and I was glad to hear that I would have the opportunity to revise my earlier work, and I look forward to further revisions as my career advances, but for the time being, this is what I've got.

I went with a similar framework with a navbar on top, but because I know a little about bootstrap, I made it look much sleeker with name and nav tabs on the left, and nav tabs to the external pages on the right.

I made the portfolio a lot cuter with a hero image of my dog Andi and I added some color elements to the rows and colums below the hero image that are containers for the other information categories needed in the portfolio. To make the choices easy and appropriate to myself, I used the color schemes of my favorite baseball teams, the Dodgers and the A's. Love it or loathe it!

### coming up shy...

I wish it weren't the case, but I ran out of time before I was able to assemble the images of my previous work and display them in the row holding that purpose. I swear I'll rectify that as soon as I can breathe.
